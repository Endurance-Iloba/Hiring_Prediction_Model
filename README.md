# Hiring Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a candidate will be hired based on historical recruitment data.

## Objective
To analyze hiring patterns and develop a predictive model that supports data-driven recruitment decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains candidate attributes such as:
- Experience
- Test Scores / Interview Scores
- Education Level
- Skills / Certifications
- Hiring Outcome (Target Variable)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection / encoding
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Machine Learning Techniques
- Train-test split
- Classification algorithm(s)
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.)

## Results
Summary of model performance and prediction accuracy.

## Key Insights
- Features most influential in hiring decisions
- Observed recruitment patterns
- Practical implications

## Conclusion
The predictive model demonstrates how data can assist HR teams in making objective and consistent hiring decisions.

## Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Dataset (`.csv`)
